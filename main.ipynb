    "### **1. State Transitions (Gillespie)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gillespie algorithm helps model the motors jump between chemical states. In order to achieve this, at every time step ($\\Delta t$), it will determine if a transition occurs. If a transition occurs it will determine what new state the system belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process provides the necessary information in order to calculate the new target angle:\n",
    "* The `transition_matrix` stores the probabilities of these jump, from one state to another\n",
    "* The algorithm uses these rates to determine if a state change occurs each step ($\\Delta t$)\n",
    "* Through this method two variables are returned\n",
    "  * A `cycle_count` variable tracks full rotations (forward and backward) in order to ensure the angle updates properly\n",
    "  * A `new_state` variable tracks the current state of the system\n",
    "* Using these variables allows us to finally update our angle toward the current equilibrium point \n",

    "The bead acts as if it is in a well, trying to reach the equilibrium point. Despite its efforts, external factors such as thermal energy ($\\text{k}_{\\rm B} T$) cause random fluctuations that kick the bead around. From this summary the simulation will have to account for two forces:\n",
